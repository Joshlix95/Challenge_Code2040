## API Challenge -Code2040
=======================

The API challenge is an amazing exercise for programmers with engaging problems. It is such a tool that helps to reinforce some forgotten references about libraries' usage. Through a careful execution of my work, lot of interactions with the API urls were mostly the challenging part, when it comes to request my "token" for example. 

I structured my work as one "block", (in one file) because the project itself was not so long to require sequencing. In my one file, three main parts can easily be identified:

#### I. Part One

The first part started by defining helpful functions considered as the basement of my work. These defined functions mainly execute four main challenges:

1. *Registration*: to figure out my token which is the main key to solve the whole challenge.

2. *Get the challenge*: to request challenges from the API.  

3. *Validate my challenge*: to append or submit my answers to the API after solving the challenge.

4. *Grades*: to verify my grades. The API here returns the result of each of the four phases of the challenge.

#### II. Part Two

My next part dealt with solutions to coding problems given in the challenge's instructions. In my python file (Challenge-Code2040.py), clear codes about "Reversed string", "Prefix", "Needle in a Haystack" and "Dating game" are treated. The challenging experience on this part was to find appropriate modules for the dating game challenge. To match the datetime format with the one of the date returned by the API (by the usage of the "getchallenge" code) was somehow stretching.

#### III. Part Three

The last part, added just as an ornament, was about the structure of the whole challenge. The purpose here was to built functions which can help a person (challenge taker) to navigate easily through all the API challenge with a freedom to call for a challenge of choice. Return values are convenient answers which are related to the request.

The API challenge has been another coding experience to remember. I truly enjoyed it.
